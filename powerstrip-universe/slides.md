#### Orchestration

A developer needs to describe WHAT services to run.  This means they can define a **manifest** of somekind.

```yaml
helloworld:
  image: binocarlos/hello
  cmd: echo "hello world!"
backflip:
  image: binocarlos/backflip
  cmd: jump --count 3
```

#### Scheduling

Something needs to decide WHERE the services run.  In a multi-host environment this means a **scheduler** must make informed decisions.

#### Monitoring

Something needs to KEEP the services running.  This means continously watching your services to ensure they are healthy and restarted them if they fail.

#### Set out to fail

Design your code so that if services fail - they will not dissapoint.
