#### Containers (Docker, rkt) are "operating system virtualisation"

 * each container shares the same kernel as the host
 * containers can have different linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS - only linux)
 * each process has isolated network, file system, user ids and process tree
 * Containers are small and fast (~1 second startup)
