### Pluggable Storage Backends

Flocker is designed to use **storage backends**.

We are working hard with some of the biggest vendors to develop backends for their storage solutions.

 * VMWare
 * EMC

When used in this way, Flocker becomes an **abstraction** for a range of storage solutions and not a single, fixed solution.
